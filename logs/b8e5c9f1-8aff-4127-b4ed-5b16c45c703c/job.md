Use web search to find the homepage content of thekaraokekillers.com, extract the relevant information from the search results, and save it as a markdown file at `data/thekaraokekillers_homepage_<timestamp>.md`. If the file already exists, append a timestamp to the filename to avoid overwriting. Implement detailed error handling for search failures, content extraction issues, and network errors. Log all intermediate steps for debugging.
